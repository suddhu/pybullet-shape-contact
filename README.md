# pybullet-shape-contact

Object shape exploration pybullet simulator for shape and pose recovery work. I got the codebase setup with a little help from my friends: [pybullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/tree/master/examples/pybullet), [public-push-est](https://github.com/mcubelab/push-est-public), and [pybullet-kuka-block-push](https://github.com/Nima-Fazeli/pybullet-kuka-block-push).
